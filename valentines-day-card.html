           <p>Happy Valentine's Day! ðŸ’–</p>
            <p>You are the most important person in my life, and today, I want to remind you just how much I love and appreciate you. Every day spent with you is a blessing, and I can't imagine my life without you by my side. You make my world brighter and fill my heart with joy.</p>
            <p>I hope one day the time and effort we been putting on each other will pay off. I am not a kind of a guy kase to give false hopes to a person just to let her overthinking go away but to tell what the truth is. Moving on the day I hope will come where we can be together I can give you treats and cuddle as much as we want </p>
            <p>for last couple of months I knew I applied for visa the only reason of me coming to school is you lang i didnt really care soo much about the grades that time a day of talking with u makes me the happiest person kaayo then yeah reserving seats for u at the morning then end up u dont sit with me:ðŸ˜”. Before you coming into my life I barely even used any social media and the day we meant boom. Thank you for being you and for all the love you give so freely. I look forward to spending many more Valentine's Days with you and creating countless more memories together. I love you more than words can express!</p>
            <p>May our love continue to grow stronger with each passing day. Happy Valentine's Day to the one who holds my heart forever. ðŸ’•</p>
